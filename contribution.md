# Style Guide

## PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Separate top-level functions and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Method definitions inside a class should be separated by one blank line.
- Imports should be on separate lines and grouped in the following order: standard library, related third-party imports, and local application/library-specific imports.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside parentheses or brackets.
- Avoid extraneous whitespace.
- Follow the naming conventions: modules and packages should have short, lowercase names, classes should use CapWords, function and variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores.

## PEP 257: Docstring Conventions

- All modules, classes, and functions should have docstrings.
- One-liners are for short, simple functions or methods.
- Multi-line docstrings have a summary line, followed by a blank line and a more elaborate description.
- Use triple double-quotes for docstrings, even for one-liners.
