# Choosing LangChain for Context-Based Question Answering

In the context of the project "Custom Knowledge using HuggingFace with LangChain" LangChain is chosen as a crucial component for context-based question answering. Several factors contribute to the decision to use LangChain:

1. **PDF Processing Capabilities:** LangChain provides the ability to efficiently process PDF documents. PDFs often contain valuable information, and in this project, LangChain is employed to load PDFs and perform text extraction.

2. **Text Chunking:** LangChain offers a text splitting mechanism that allows for the division of large documents into smaller, manageable "chunks." This is essential for working with lengthy documents, as it helps to maintain context and enables more efficient processing.

3. **Text Embeddings:** To enable context-based question answering, LangChain integrates with text embeddings. In this project, HuggingFace embeddings are used to represent text in a numerical format, making it suitable for similarity searches and question answering.

4. **Vector Database:** LangChain's integration with FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) allows for efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings. This is crucial for quickly finding relevant information when answering user queries.

5. **Integration with Conversational Chains:** LangChain can be seamlessly integrated into conversational chains. This feature enables chatbots and virtual assistants to maintain a chat history and provide coherent responses based on previous interactions.

In summary, LangChain is chosen for its comprehensive capabilities in handling PDFs, text chunking, text embeddings, and vector database management. These features make it a suitable choice for building a context-based question answering system within the project.

# HuggingFace Models for Answer Retrieval

In the project "Custom Knowledge using HuggingFace with LangChain," HuggingFace models play a significant role in retrieving answers to user queries. Specifically, the following HuggingFace models are used:

1. **Language Model (LLM):** The project employs a Language Model (LLM) from HuggingFace's model repository. The LLM used here is from the repository "google/flan-t5-large." This model serves as a language generation model capable of answering questions and providing responses based on the knowledge base.

   - **Model Parameters:** The LLM is configured with specific parameters, including a temperature setting of 0.3 and a maximum response length of 512 tokens. These parameters influence the generation of responses, ensuring they are coherent and concise.

2. **ConversationalRetrievalChain:** LangChain is used to create a "ConversationalRetrievalChain" that leverages the LLM for question answering. This chain integrates the LLM with the vector database created from PDF documents. It allows for context-based responses by retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base.

   - **Usage:** The ConversationalRetrievalChain takes user queries and maintains a chat history. It utilizes the LLM and the vector database to provide answers to user questions by considering the context of previous interactions.

Certainly! Here's an addition to the Markdown file that explains how to run the provided code in Google Colab:

# How to Run the Code in Google Colab

5. **Follow the Project Steps:**
   - The Markdown cells in the notebook provide explanations and instructions for each step of the project.
   - Execute the code cells one by one to see the project's progress and understand its functionality.

6. **Input User Queries:**
   - As the code is executed, you will reach the section where you can input user queries to interact with the chatbot.
   - Type your questions or queries into the provided input box.

7. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   - The code will use LangChain and HuggingFace models to provide responses to your queries.
   - The chatbot maintains a chat history, and you can continue the conversation by entering more questions.

8. **Exit the Chatbot:**
   - To exit the chatbot interaction, you can type 'exit' into the input box.
   - The chatbot will provide a closing message.

9. **Explore Results and Visualizations:**
   - The code also includes data visualization elements, such as histograms, to illustrate the token count distribution of text chunks.

10. **Save or Export Your Work:**
    - You can save your changes in the Google Colab notebook, export it, or download it for reference or further exploration.

By following these steps, you can run the code in Google Colab and interact with the custom knowledge chatbot that uses LangChain and HuggingFace models for context-based question answering.

# How to Run the Code Locally
